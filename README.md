## Introduction

> A news headliner pwa built for the ALC **Take A Climb Challenge** Web Intermediate Track.

It is clean, customisable and curates searchable notable news sources that deliver breaking news to the readers. Zoom uses [NewsAPI](http://www.newsapi.org) to display headlines which can be customised based on country, category or news source. Readers can also create news lists and tags for the headlines.
